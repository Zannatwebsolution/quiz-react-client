                    Have you ever wondered whether or not your employees really got anything out of their last training session? Instead of wondering, why not find out for sure? Quizzing your workforce can give you a clear insight into how much information your employees actually absorbed, as well as act as a handy reminder.
                    <br />
                    A training session is usually the first thing that springs to mind when it comes to educating your workforce. Loads of training sessions, however, might not always be the best idea. Not only do they take employees away from their desks for long periods of time, studies show that 70 percent of newly absorbed information is already forgotten within 24 hours anyway.
                    <br />
                    This is where quizzes can come in handy. By quizzing your employees on a regular basis, you can educate them in a playful manner without them having to continuously leave their desks. An added bonus is increased knowledge retention. Regularly quizzing your staff members helps them to better remember what they were thought during a training session.
                    <br />
                    Not a big fan of training sessions? Quizzes can also perfectly serve as your sole training tool as well.

                    <h2>Why are quizzes useful?</h2>
                    <p>There are plenty of things that you can learn from quizzing your workforce. You can create quizzes to test how much attention your employees paid at a recent meeting, find out how many employees actually absorbed the information they needed from their latest training session or see how many employees read the company blog or newsletter. Even if you’re struggling with safety protocols, for example, you can create a quiz to see how many employees are actually familiar with them. Needless to say the possibilities are endless.</p>

                    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

                    <p>Your quiz can either appear sporadically on your screensaver or pop up right away on your employees’ computer screen on a specific time and date. Want to send specific quizzes to specific people or departments? No problem. Quizzes can be targeted to groups or even individuals. This way you don’t bother HR with IT quizzes and vice versa.</p> 

                    <h2>quizzing</h2>
                    <p>Just keep in mind that the end of a training session shouldn’t be the end of the learning process. Quiz your employees to make them remember important information longer and more effectively.
